# Description

Otool is a database visual wep application.

# Run this project

I have built this project one year ago (2018) , and I am a rookie in Java EE. So run this project will be kind of difficult.

- Import the project in your eclipse.
- Recorrect the build path configuration like JRE, Apache Tomacat.
- (Optional) Maybe you need to recorrect the project factes.
- Make sure your have oracle database or you can modify code to support other database.
- The last thing is to delopy the project in tomcat server(suggest 8.5) and run it.

# Want to say

I program the project without framework both on back-end and front-end. And that makes me know that you can't build a prefect system/sofware without framework in a short time. So thank all excellent opensource project!
